# embeddable-react

This Repo consists of the final version of the code implemented and discussed in [this blog](#https://observiq.com/blog/embed-react-in-golang/).

## Bootstrapping

For the code to compile you need to build the React app.

```sh
cd ui && npm run build
```

Then you can build and serve the app with.

```sh
go build
./embedded-react-final
```
